# dotfiles
Linux config files (currently lots of example configs, will customize at some point)

-- currently using:

 - leftwm
 - alacritty
 - rlaunch
 - polybar
 - feh

## Todo:

 - create an update script, to run alongside `pacman -Syu`
 - more nvim things

for setup, pull this, copy `setmeup.sh` into the home directory and run it
